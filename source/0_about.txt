Reqy is an open source command line requirements managemer. It helps manage which requirements get made during the software life cycle. Requirements, supporting documentation and traces between them are tracked and can be comunicated via generated artifacts. 

* Track requiremnts using meta data attributes
* Maintain traces (links) between requirements and documentation
* Generate views and reports of the requirements
* Impact analysis of proposed requirement changes (change management)

The main design goals of *reqy* are to be focused and light weight. Requirements are plain text files and are organized in directories, meaning they are easily managed using existing shell tools and can be put under version controll.

Requirements describe what done looks like. Requirements management is ensuring everyone on the project is working towards the same 'done'. Reqy allows project requirements to be managed and communicated.

Reqy is a command line requirements management tool for maintaining a requirements repository, including traces(links between items), stakeholders and project documentation. The repository can be visualized via generated artifacts, such as reports, Requirements Traceability Matrix or Dependency graphs.
